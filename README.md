# stock-analysis
Bootcamp Module 2 - VBA
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze stocks for Steve and his parents from 2017 and 2018 to see how their DQ stock has performed and to understand which other stocks would be benefiical to add to their portfolio. Additionally, it provides Steve the opportunity to upload additional stocks from future years and track how they are performing.

## Results
### 2017

In 2017, every stock had a positive return except for TERP. Steve's parents were probably overjoyed with the fact that DQ knocked it out of the part with a nearly 200% return that year. The code ran almost instantaneously this year as well and substantially faster than the 2018 code.
### 2018

Compared to 2017, the 2018 code did not run nearly as fast (albeit still quickly in .08 seconds). The stocks this year did not perform nearly as well, as the only stocks that netted a positive return were ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84%). Unfortunately for Steve's parents, DQ tanked in 2018 with the worst return at -62.6%, and certainly indicates that Steve needs to help them diversify their portfolio.

## Refactoring Code Advantages/Disadvantages
### General Advantages/Disadvantages
Refactoring code makes life easier because it is easier for the coder to debug and for later use to edit and reuse. It is also simpler and shorter so that there are fewer chances for there to be errors in the code and it helps the analysis to run faster. Unfortuantely, refactoring code can also introduce bugs into the code if you don't know what you're doing and is also time consuming. 

### Specific Advantages/Disadvantages to this situation
In the VBA Challenge, it obviously significantly reduced the amount of time for the code to run and would allow for Steve to add more stocks to analyze. It also gave me the ability to ask which year I would like to analyze and immediately get results for all stocks in a given year and not just for DQ in 2018. On the downside, it took a lot of extra time to debug the code and my code wasn't working for a significant amount of time after I started refactoring it. Thankfully, I was able to get some assistance and my code works now!
